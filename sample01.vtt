00:05.501 --> 00:06.462
What are you?

00:06.662 --> 00:07.643
Oh, I'm OK.

00:08.364 --> 00:08.944
I will be.

00:08.964 --> 00:10.266
I said she could stay with us, Mum.

00:10.286 --> 00:11.327
I just thought she feels better.

00:11.347 --> 00:11.447
Yeah.

00:11.987 --> 00:13.629
Of course she can.

00:13.669 --> 00:15.070
Oh, this won't be for long.

00:15.190 --> 00:17.352
Well, you can stay as long as you want my love.

00:17.412 --> 00:18.914
You really missed you.

00:19.494 --> 00:19.975
Pops.

00:20.415 --> 00:22.177
Great to see you, love.

00:22.197 --> 00:22.237
Oh.

00:23.238 --> 00:24.419
All right, shall we get you off to bed then?

00:24.599 --> 00:26.021
You should have given me some warm.

00:26.041 --> 00:27.742
I'll have to put the electric blanket on.

00:27.802 --> 00:28.082
Sorry.

00:28.103 --> 00:29.123
All right, Della.

00:29.644 --> 00:30.565
Freezing up there.

00:31.502 --> 00:33.683
In a bedroom, Peter unpacks her suitcase.

00:34.283 --> 00:36.544
The middle-aged woman opens her green case.

00:36.564 --> 00:39.064
Do you want, yeah, PJs?

00:39.084 --> 00:39.304
Yeah.

00:39.885 --> 00:40.185
Yeah.

00:42.385 --> 00:49.328
Lifting a bundle of pajamas, Peter finds a sheet of paper labeled Lancaster North Hospital Discharged Sheet.

00:50.308 --> 00:52.909
He closes the suitcase and brings glory to the pajamas.

00:52.949 --> 00:53.309
There you go.

00:54.229 --> 00:54.809
Thank you.

00:55.670 --> 00:56.770
He picks up the locket.

00:57.150 --> 00:57.550
He kept it.

00:57.570 --> 00:59.991
Oh, of course.
