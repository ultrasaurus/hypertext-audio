I said she could stay with us, Mum.
I just thought she feels better.
Yeah.
Of course she can.
Oh, this won't be for long.
Well, you can stay as long as you want my love.
You really missed you.
Pops.
Great to see you, love.
Oh.
All right, shall we get you off to bed then?

Sorry.
All right, Della.

In a bedroom, Peter unpacks her suitcase.

He closes the suitcase and brings glory to the pajamas.

Thank you.
He picks up the locket.
He kept it.
Oh, of course.
