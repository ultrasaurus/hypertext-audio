1
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:06,462
What are you?

2
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:07,643
Oh, I'm OK.

3
00:00:08,364 --> 00:00:08,944
I will be.

4
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:10,266
I said she could stay with us, Mum.

5
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:11,327
I just thought she feels better.

6
00:00:11,347 --> 00:00:11,447
Yeah.

7
00:00:11,987 --> 00:00:13,629
Of course she can.

8
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:15,070
Oh, this won't be for long.

9
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,352
Well, you can stay as long as you want my love.

10
00:00:17,412 --> 00:00:18,914
You really missed you.

11
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:19,975
Pops.

12
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:22,177
Great to see you, love.

13
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:22,237
Oh.

14
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:24,419
All right, shall we get you off to bed then?

15
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,021
You should have given me some warm.

16
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,742
I'll have to put the electric blanket on.

17
00:00:27,802 --> 00:00:28,082
Sorry.

18
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:29,123
All right, Della.

19
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:30,565
Freezing up there.

20
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:33,683
In a bedroom, Peter unpacks her suitcase.

21
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:36,544
The middle-aged woman opens her green case.

22
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:39,064
Do you want, yeah, PJs?

23
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:39,304
Yeah.

24
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:40,185
Yeah.

25
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:49,328
Lifting a bundle of pajamas, Peter finds a sheet of paper labeled Lancaster North Hospital Discharged Sheet.

26
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:52,909
He closes the suitcase and brings glory to the pajamas.

27
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:53,309
There you go.

28
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,809
Thank you.

29
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,770
He picks up the locket.

30
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,550
He kept it.

31
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,991
Oh, of course.
